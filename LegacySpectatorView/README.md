# README

**These instructions are for the UNET implementation of spectator view**
For the **HoloToolkit sharing service** implementation, see the [Legacy Documentation](./LegacyDocs/SharingService/README.md).

![Spectator View Rig](./DocumentationImages/spectatorview.jpg)

## Overview
Spectator view uses an external camera rigidly mounted to a HoloLens to take high definition pictures and video of your holographic Unity project. Unlike Mixed Reality Capture (MRC),  the Spectator View project allows for high resolution captures from a third person perspective   Use this project to capture higher resolution and higher quality pictures for your store submissions, marketing videos, or for projecting a live view for all spectators to see.

**DISCLAIMER:** Video recording is in alpha and you might experience some latency between hologram position in video to real-life.  Move the camera slower or target a stationary camera to mitigate this.


## Material List
Note: The linked materials are not the only materials that will work, but are the ones that we used.
Make sure the materials you get are compatible with your existing camera.

+ Restart Visual Studio if the Calibration or Compositor sln's are open.


## Included Projects
Each project has its own README with additional overview and setup instructions.  See Documentation links below.
### Calibration
Calibrates the HoloLens to the external camera.  Uses a checkerboard pattern to find the rotation and translation from the HoloLens to the external camera.  This process also finds the vertical field of view of the attached camera so holograms can be rendered at the correct projection to the camera.
### Compositor
Unity Editor window that renders holograms from Unity over a color frame from a capture card.  Outputs photo and video of the scene.  This must be built and copied to your Unity project using CopyDLL.cmd.
### Samples\SharedHolograms
Sample demonstrating how to add the HolographicCameraRig to an app that is already a shared experience.  In this case, it is a simple shared experience using [UNET](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNet.html).
### CopyDLL.cmd
If you have changed any #define in CompositorShared.h, run this cmd to copy DLL's that depend on those definitions to your Unity projects.  Include the Assets path to your own project to copy there.


## Camera Setup
If using a camera with a capture card, you must configure the camera to output correctly:
+ Change your camera to Video Mode.  This will allow the output image to fill the whole buffer, rather than letterboxing to the picture aspect ratio.
+ Find your camera's HDMI settings - enable "dual monitor" or "mirroring".
+ Set the resolution to 1080P
+ Turn off "Live view on screen display" so any screen overlays on the live view are not shown in the composite.
+ Turn on your camera's live view.
+ If using the Canon SDK and would like to use a flash unit, disable "Silent LV Shoot"
+ Plug an hdmi cable from the camera's hdmi port to the hdmi in port of the capture card.
    + This is the outer port on the Blackmagic capture card.
+ Optionally plug an hdmi cable from the hdmi out port to a television or preview monitor.
    + This is the center port on the Blackmagic capture card.

Note: if you would like to capture images or video at a resolution other than 1080P (eg: Photo Mode, 720P, or 4K) there will be a small code change mentioned in the individual projects' README's.


## Network Setup
+ The networking stack requires UDP broadcast to be enabled on your network.
+ If you are on a corporate network that does not have this enabled, you may need to use a [router](https://www.amazon.com/D-Link-Tri-Band-Performance-Beamforming-DIR-890L/dp/B00PVD81MK/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1496459664&sr=8-3)
    + Plug an ethernet cable from your PC into the router.
    + Connect your HoloLens devices to this router.
+ Ensure your HoloLens devices and Unity can talk to each other by opening up UDP and TCP communication to Unity in your firewall settings.
    + Open the **Control Panel**.
    + Select **System and Security**.
    + Select **Windows Firewall**.
    + Select **Advanced Settings**.
    + Select **Inbound Rules**.
    + Find **Unity Editor** and ensure the **Program** path is the version of Unity you are using.
    + Double click on the Unity Editor line with the **UDP** protocol.
    + Select **Allow the connection**.
    + Select **Advanced**.
    + Select the **profiles** that will work for your router.  (At least **Private** must be checked when using a router.)
    + Select **Apply**.
    + Repeat for the **TCP** protocol.


## Spectator View Rig Setup
This section assumes you are using the included HoloLens bracket.  Alternative mounting techniques can be used instead.

![Assembly](./DocumentationImages/assembly.gif)

+ Use a T7 screwdriver to remove the headband from the HoloLens.
    + Once screws are loose, poke them out with a paperclip from the other side.
+ Remove the screw cap on the inside front of the HoloLens visor, you can do this with a small flat head screwdriver.

![HoloLens with no headband](./DocumentationImages/headband.jpg)

+ Use a T15 screwdriver to remove the small torx bolts from the HoloLens bracket to remove the U and Hook-shaped attachments.
+ Place the HoloLens on the bracket, lining up the exposed hole on the inside of the visor with the extrusion on the front of the bracket.
    + HoloLens arms should be kept in place by the pins on the bottom of the bracket.
+ Reattach the U and Hook-shaped attachments to secure the HoloLens to the bracket.

![Bracket](./DocumentationImages/bracket_HoloLens.jpg)

+ Attach the hotshoe fastener to the hotshoe of your camera.
+ Attach the mount adapter to the hotshoe fastener.

![Adapter](./DocumentationImages/adapter.jpg)

+ Rotate the adapter so the narrow side is facing forward and parallel to the camera's lens.
+ Secure the adapter in place with a 1/4" nut using the 7/16 nut driver.
+ Position the bracket against the adapter so the front of the HoloLens' visor is as close as possible to the front of the camera's lens.
+ Attach the bracket with 4 1/4" nuts and bolts using the 7/16 nut driver.


## Alternate Spectator View Rig Setup
The spectator view rig assembly can be made without any custom hardware.

### Assembly
+ Attach the hotshoe fastener to the camera's hotshoe using one of the included nuts.
+ Place a washer on the hotshoe fastener above the nut.
+ Attach the dual flash bracket to the hotshoe fastener.
    + The washer should guarantee that the bracket is perpendicular to the lens.
+ Remove the included thumbscrews from the dual flash bracket.
+ Attach the clamps to each side of the dual flash bracket with the 6/32 nuts and bolts.
    + Ensure the arms of the HoloLens will be able to fit in the clamps with the visor centered on the camera's lens.
+ Place each HoloLens arm in the open clamps.
+ Place some cardboard or stiff foam in between the headband and the arms to act as a buffer against the clamp's tension.
+ Without overtightening, tighten the clamps to keep the HoloLens in place.


## Recommended PC Specs
Any PC that can run the HoloLens emulator can run spectator view.

## Adding Spectator View Support to Your Unity App
+ If your application does not use the HoloToolkit, you must first **add the HoloToolkit**.
    + This can be done from the spectator view releases in the HoloLens Companion Kit repository for a minimum set of the HoloToolkit for spectator view compatibility.
    + Find the largest number subdirectory for the latest official release.
    + Import the **HoloToolkit_Min_%number%.unitypackage**
+ Import the **SpectatorView_%number%.unitypackage** from [releases](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloLensCompanionKit/releases), to add the spectator view code to your project.
+ Add the **"Addons\HolographicCameraRig\Prefabs\SpectatorViewManager"** prefab to your Hierarchy.
+ Add the **"Addons\HolographicCameraRig\SV_UNET\Prefabs\Sharing** prefab to your Hierarchy.
+ Build **"Compositor\Compositor.sln"** for x86 and x64 and run **CopyDLL.cmd** with the Assets directory of your project as the only parameter.
    + For more information and build configuration options, read the [compositor README](Compositor/README.md).
+ Restart Unity for DLLs to import.
+ For more information, read the [sample README](Samples/README.md).
